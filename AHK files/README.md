## AHK files

AHK stands for [Auto Hot Key](https://autohotkey.com/).

Basically _Autohotkey_ hooks into Windows and changes word sequences according
to your definitions.

This is useful for:

- automatic correction of spelling mistakes
- automatic addition of accents and the likes to words, e.g. déjà vu
- replacements of abbreviations, e.g. br -> best regards
- access to characters that are not on the keyboard, such as: —, ·, •, ¹, ½,
  etc.
- reassigning keys of your keyboard
